Run the example script simply by entering 

	python3 example-vision.py

in the terminal here. Make sure you have installed PyTorch first to implement the example.

In this example, we trained Cobweb/4V with sampled `size_tr=1000` training examples in the MNIST dataset, and then test it with the entire MNIST test set (10,000 test examples in total). You can try different settings in the example script. Lastly, we can derive the visualization of the trained Cobweb/4V tree.
